Description: In breeding experiments, mating environmental (ME) designs are very popular as mating designs are directly implemented in the field environment using block or row-column designs. Here, three functions are given related to three new methods which will generate mating diallel cross designs (Hinkelmann and Kempthorne, 1963<doi:10.2307/2333899>) or mating environmental (ME) designs along with design parameters, C matrix, eigenvalues (EVs), degree of fractionations (DF) and canonical efficiency factor (CEF). Another one function is added to check the properties of a given ME diallel cross design.
